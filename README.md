# BST-Visualiser-netbeams-project

This was a college project that grew a little more complex than it needed to be. Now i have decided to let it live on github to help other college students / self learners. Please star this repository if it helps you !

**Instructions for install :**

simply clone the repository, add it to your netbeams projects folder.<br> 
Open netbeams , Open project, then run file. 

**UI seen on launch :**

The top text box is for input, the bottom one is for output.

The way to add new nodes, is to enter space separated values in the input section. After that, click the add button. An animation will play as the nodes are added.

Deleting is a similar process. Enter space separated integers and it will delete the nodes in that order. Note that the delete here is BST delete, so in case of 2 child case, left node's right most node is placed on postion of deleted node.

There is another button called cmd. A lot of miscellaneous commands may be used with this button. These are as follows : 

1. in-order <br>
\> outputs in-order traversal of the tree <br>

2. level-order <br>
\> outputs level order traversal of the tree <br>

3. height <br>
\> outputs current height of the tree <br>

4. pre-order <br>
\> outputs pre-order traversal of the tree <br>

5. post-order <br>
\> outputs post-order traversal of the tree <br>

6. as-fast<br>
\> fast animations<br>

7. as-normal <br>
\> default animation speed <br>

8. as-none <br>
\> disables animations <br>

9. vertices <br>
\> outputs current number of vertices / nodes <br>
